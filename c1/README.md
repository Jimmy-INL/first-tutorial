# c1 tutorial

In this tutorial we will plot the analytical solution against the numerical solution of a laminar flow in pipe.

The numerical solution is obtained using openfoam 2.3.x.  

In the file pipe.zip you will find the openfoam dictionaries.

To follow this tutorial you will need the numerical solution, which is located in the folder postProcessing.  You will need to keep the same directory structure.

In the python notebook you will find all the instructions.
